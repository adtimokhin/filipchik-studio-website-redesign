## Introduction

This is my first project in Astro, and I followed my own design to create it. This project includes technologies such as Astro, React, Tailwind, and GSAP. Additionally, this is the first project I have done with GSAP animations.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ careers.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ online/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ podcast.astro
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ talks.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ projects/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ aviasales.astro
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ bfd.astro
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ roblox.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 404.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for .astro or .md files in the src/pages/ directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about src/components/, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public/ directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:


| Command                   | Action                                           |
